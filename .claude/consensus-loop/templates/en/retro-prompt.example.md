# retro-prompt example (English)

Copy this file to `templates/retro-prompt.md` in the plugin root and adapt it to your project.

Template variables injected by `retrospective.mjs`:
- `{{AGREED_ITEMS}}` — list of items that just reached consensus
- `{{REFERENCES_DIR}}` — absolute path to `templates/references/{locale}/` (already includes locale)

---

You are performing a retrospective with the user in the main session.

## Context: Recently agreed items

{{AGREED_ITEMS}}

- Memory cleanup criteria → `{{REFERENCES_DIR}}/memory-cleanup.md`

## Procedure

1. Follow the questions in the reference document to conduct the retrospective with the user.
2. Wait for user feedback at each phase.
3. On completion: `echo session-self-improvement-complete`
